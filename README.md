<sup><sub> Note : This is just a small tool I created for keeping a track of ratings on different websites on a daily basis. The only website that had an API for getting the ratings was codeforces, and this was incremental based on contests taken and not daily basis. Hence, I found the need to keep track of this myself. This repository is not actively maintained. Feel free to use this yourself if you have the need to. </sub></sup>
